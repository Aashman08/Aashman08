<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aashman Rastogi (Aashman08)</h1> 
<h3 align="center">A junior majoring in Statistics and Data Science at UCLA</h3> 

I'm passionate about the fascinating worlds of remote sensing and space exploration. As an avid enthusiast, I find myself captivated by the endless possibilities that lie beyond our planet. Remote sensing, in particular, has piqued my curiosity due to its ability to gather valuable information about Earth from a distance. From satellite imagery to LiDAR data, I am intrigued by the immense potential of using these technologies to study our planet's dynamic ecosystems, monitor climate change, and contribute to sustainable development. Exploring the depths of space and understanding our place in the universe is also a significant interest of mine. I find it awe-inspiring to learn about the latest advancements in astrophysics, planetary science, and space exploration missions. Through my GitHub projects, I aim to combine my passion for remote sensing and space, leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques to contribute to these exciting fields. Join me on this journey as we uncover the mysteries of our world and beyond!
